            <a href="https://nicepage.com/css-templates/preview/school-of-successful-business-194359?device=desktop">Nice Page</a> 
            <p>This design is very clean looking and they were not afraid of having empty white space.  By having this white space it allows the page to be very readable by allowing the reading to view one thing at a time rather then having everything packed closely.</p>

            <a href="https://nicepage.com/css-templates/preview/ralph-lauren-fashion-27456?device=desktop">Nice Page</a>
            <p>The contrast in this image makes the different elements shown very readable. The text is easy to see and read along with the button having a litter color but still allowing it to stand out.</p>

            <a href="https://nicepage.com/css-templates/preview/creative-writing-courses-183435?device=desktop">Nice Page</a>
            <p>Fitt's Law is a predictive model which is based on the speed it takes to get to an item on a website, is based on the location and size of that item.  In this image you can see there is a button that was palced right in the middle area of the page making it very easy to get to it.</p>
